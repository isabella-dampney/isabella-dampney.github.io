  <h1>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h1>
</header>
<br>
<br>
  <h3>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people
</h3>
<div class="green-box-main">
    <p>Understanding neuroplasticity helps people to know that their learning potential isn’t fixed. We often set limits for ourselves in terms of what we are capable of, this has real effects in terms of how we learn. If we know that our brains are malleable and capable of growth, even as adults then we allow ourselves to learn challenging things. If we believe we are incapable of brain growth and learning then our development stays fixed and we live within the limits we set for ourselves. Brain plasticity isn’t just about belief either, it’s a proven that adults are capable of brain growth. This can be seen through the recovery of people with brain injury, stroke etc. </p>
</div>
<br>

  <h3>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit</h3>
<div class="green-box-main">
    <p>Learning a brand new skill is challenging, and negative thoughts about your ability to learn difficult things makes it even harder. I have some beliefs that are potentially not conducive to learning programming such as that I am not good at maths, “I don’t think like that”. I think always maintaining that even as an adult I have not reached my full potential, and that my brain is capable of developing new skills that are challenging, but not impossible, is important. It’s great to know that our brains are incredible machines with unlimited potential of growth. If we work at something and put in the energy and hours we can develop pathways to strengthen new skills. </p>
    <p>I think the aphorism “practise makes perfect” is flawed, it’s about how you practise and what you want to get out of it. I used to think of it as “practise makes permanent”.  But I also know this not to be true now, because we can always develop and relearn our skills even as adults. </p>
</div>
<br>

  <h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>
<div class="green-box-main">
   <p>The first and most important way to increase your neuroplasticity is to know that you can. If you believe that you can’t you will put in roadblocks to your own learning. If you believe that you can, you allow your mind to expand to the potential and allow yourself to be challenged. </p>
   <p>Another way to increase your neuroplasticity is to actually work on what it is you want to develop. You will not get anywhere if you don’t put in the hours and hard work to develop and strengthen those neural pathways. </p>

  <h3>Research Growth Mindset: Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</h3>
<div class="green-box-main">
  <p>A growth mindset is the knowledge that your brain is capable of growth and development. It’s allowing yourself to grow by making the decision that you are capable of growth. </p>
  <p>It’s relevant because we are studying material that is challenging for many of us, myself included. I come from a completely different background than programming and I’ve been having a hard time with imposter syndrome. But if we allow ourselves to learn the material and know that we are capable of it because our brains are malleable and our potential isn’t fixed then we will learn the skills. </p>
</div>
<br>

  <h3>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>
<div class="green-box-main">
  <p>I have always known that our brains are malleable, but honestly didn’t completely consider that even as an adult my brain is plastic. Sometimes I feel that the best years of my learning potential are over, but this exercise has helped remind me that it is not and that it’s completely up to me how much I learn. </p>
</div>
<br>

  <h3>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h3>
<div class="green-box-main">
    <p>I will integrate it through mindfulness training, and we need to have a clear mind in order to learn and take in new information. I will also try and maintain a growth mindset and remembrance when I am struggling with something and imposter syndrome kicks in. </p>
</div>
<br>

  <h3>Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging.</h3>
<div class="green-box-main">
    <p>Here is a helpful resource to remind ourselves of these ideas: https://hbr.org/2016/01/what-having-a-growth-mindset-actually-means</p>
</div>
<br>

  <h3>Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.</h3>
<div class="green-box-main">
    <p>As I mentioned earlier, I will do my best to maintain a growth mindset when I encounter challenging exercises or ideas. Also in my learning plan we were asked to discuss our limitations, I think a growth mindset can be very helpful when considering the limitations we believe we hold. </p>

  <h1>EQ vs. IQ </h1>
</header>
<br>
  <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
<div class="green-box-main">
  <p>Emotional Intelligence is defined as a skill set which encompasses social and emotional literacy, as well as an ability to manage and self-regulate one’s emotions. Emotional intelligence can be learned and developed, it is not something fixed or innate, though some people may find it easier depending on their background or upbringing. Having a ‘high’ EQ may mean you have an easier time navigating social environments, better self-awareness when speaking and listening, and an ability to understand and harness the emotions and emotional state of those around you. Having a good Emotional Intelligence also increases your ability to empathize and relate to those around you. 
</p>
</div>

<br>
  <h3>How is it different to Intelligence Quotient?</h3>
<div class="green-box-main">
    <p>IEQ and IQ are quite different. IQ is defined as Intelligence Quotient, and is a set of standardized tests to measure one’s problem solving, analytical skills, logical reasoning, and spatial awareness. The measurements for IQ are contested, but as a concept IQ still holds some weight. IQ tests are often used in education, mental health assessment, in criminal justice, and during hiring processes. </p>
    <p>As a whole, the combination of EQ and IQ covers the two aspects of human intelligence. EQ was theorised as a way to grapple and measure intelligence that is not solely “book smarts”. Humans are complex, multifaceted individuals, and the combination of EQ and IQ is an attempt to understand some of these complexities and standardize the measurement of them. </p>
</div>

<br>
  <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
<div class="green-box-main">
    <p>Understanding EQ and IQ means that we can begin to see how they influence and shape our outlook on the world. EQ can often be neglected, however improving one’s EQ can increase job performance, social satisfaction, and productivity. Our brains are malleable and if we feel that aspects of our EQ are lacking or need development, this is possible through the practise of listening and attention exercises, active self-awareness, and mindfulness. </p>
