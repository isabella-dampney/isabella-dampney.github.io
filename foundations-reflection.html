  <h3>
      What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?
  </h3>
<div class="green-box-main">
    <p>
      Nothing came as a big surprise. I think the main thing is that I should have more faith in myself, and to focus on my learning and not where other people are at. 
    </p>
</div>

<br>
  <h3>
      What are the role of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning and programming?
  </h3>
<div class="green-box-main">
    <p>
        I’m not sure about values, because everyone has values but they’re not necessarily good or bad, they just inform how you behave. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Empathy is important, as it is vital to maintain an empathetic point of view in the way that we programme things in order to make them accessible to a wide number of people. Also, as we will be doing a lot of peer-programming, it is good to be empathetic with the person you are programming with and also with yourself if you are struggling with something. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Self-awareness falls into the same category, as it’s good to be aware of how you are behaving when working in a group so you can be aware of how your actions are affecting others and also how you can programme so things make sense to others and not just yourself. Consciously trying to be self-aware takes you out of your head. 
    </p>

  <h3>	
      What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
  </h3>
<div class="green-box-main">
    <p>
        That it’s possible to learn really hard things even though I’m not 12 years old anymore. I found the neuroplasticity exercise very valuable in terms of maintaining a positive attitude when things were really hard. 
    </p>
</div>

<br>
  <h3>	
      What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
  </h3>
<div class="green-box-main">
  <p>
When I literally had no idea what was going on and couldn’t make sense of something. But really, I think it was being stuck on something for a really long time and getting nowhere and it sort of drives you to insanity. 
  </p>
</div>

<br>
  <h3>
    Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?
  </h3>
<div class="green-box-main">
  <p>
I think it’s because many people know how to programme, and learning to programme is hard but also very possible if you just put the time and energy into it. But programming requires you to work in teams and collaboratively, in order for that to be successful you as the worker has to be self-aware and have good people skills. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Also, at the end of the day, when you are looking for a job the hirer wants someone who can (yes) do the job, but also have a yarn with them and make the workplace a good place to be. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The focus on these core skills reminded me that it is possible to develop them. Although we can’t change who we are, we can try to be more present in our behaviour and ways of being. 
  </p>
</div>

<br>
  <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? </h3>
<div class="green-box-main">
   <p>
    Nah, it doesn’t. I found the focus on meditation helpful, and also as I mentioned the focus on neuroplasticity. Although I am still in my 20s, sometimes I even feel like it’s too late to get really good at a new skill. 
   </p>
</div>

<br>
  <h3>
      Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
  </h3>
<div class="green-box-main">
  <p>
    No I don’t think so, because I don’t think it took that long at all, and also I need breaks from programming to give my brain a rest. Neglecting the human aspect of programming would be irresponsible, because on the first day of the job I think you’d be hit with a surprise. We HAVE to work with people in this world, it’s not all AI and robots yet!
