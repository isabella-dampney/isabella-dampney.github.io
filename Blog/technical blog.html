<h3>An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS</h3>
<div class="class-id">
<p>Animals can provide a good analogy for the differences between HTML and CSS. HTML would be a turtle because it is slow and steady. A turtle is straight forward and predictable in its behaviour, and they can live for a very long time (as HTML is very old). CSS would be a monkey because it grooms other things (HTML), and it's a little showy and mischievous.</p>

<h3>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life.</h3>
<div class="class-id">
<p>Control flow in programming is the order in which function calls or statements are executed by the program. Control flow is essentially the computer program’s version of English speakers reading from left to right. For English speakers, reading left to right is our control flow. In this sentence, we read ‘In’ (1st), ‘this’ (2nd), and ‘sentence’ (3rd), that is the control flow. For humans it’s the order that the words will hit our brain. </p>
<p>A loop can interrupt this control flow because it may ask the function to execute an argument any number of times, so the program will run the loop for as long as you ask it to. Once the loop is completed the normal control flow will resume. You can liken this to getting stuck on a word while reading it and trying to understand it, perhaps you read over it a number of times, once you’ve understood you move on and completed the sentence. </p>

<h3>•	Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</h3>
<div class="class-id">
<h4>What is the DOM?</h4>
<p>It is a “Document Object Model”. In essence, it is the object representation of your entire HTML document. It is a tree like data structure, with many ‘nodes’ coming off of it much like the leaves. Everything that makes up your DOM is known as nodes. A node can be an element, attribute, text content, comments, etc. </p>
<p>The DOM is a hierarchical structure that your web browser uses to understand and make sense of all the different elements going on behind the scenes. Everything you use in HTML has an object representation in the DOM, which enables you to access these elements in JavaScript, and also modify them. The Document Object is not just for viewing purposes, you can actually use it to manipulate the document. If you make any changes with JavaScript they will be reflected in your browser. </p>
<p>The Document Object also allows for specialised interaction with the site user. Changes you make in the DOM with JavaScript can mean you can make your page respond to mouse-clicks, hovering, and detecting, when a particular key is pressed. It is essential to responsive programming.  The DOM acts as they key that allows you to work with the HTML and CSS and link to the JavaScript. </p>
<h4>What is a JavaScript ‘event’? </h4>
<p>Events are things that happen to an HTML element. If JavaScript is incorporated into an HTML document, JavaScript can respond to events that happen with the HTML. Such as a button click, a webpage loading. JavaScript lets you execute code when an event happens – this is how we can have interactive web pages. We can add the JavaScript code to HTML elements so they can respond when the event is realised. 
</p>

<h3>•	Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h3>
<div class="class-id">
<p>An array is a list of items in square brackets separated by commas, which can be used to contain data that is accessible through it’s position in the index. Strings in arrays are contained within quotes, and numbers don’t require anything. The first item in an array is at index point 0, the second at 1, and so on. Indices start at 0. Please note that arrays don’t have to be within in the square brackets, you can define the array and then provide the elements (data) that goes inside. </p>
<p>An object is a data type that stores information. Its structure follows key:value, in an object the information is stored in pairs. For example; food: bread, ingredient: flour, flourType: wholemeal. The “flourType” in this instance is the key, and “wholemeal” is the value. In an object a value can be a string, an array, a number, and even a function. You can access an object in one of two ways, firstly you can use objectName.propertyName, so in our previous example it would be objectName.flourType and the result would be “wholemeal”. When a property name contains spaces you need to use an array-type to retrieve the data from the object. Here we would have objectName[‘flour type’], and once again we would get “wholemeal”. Due to the confusion, if possible it’s good to avoid using spaces for the property name.</p>

<h3>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h3>
<div class= "class-id">
<p>A function is the building block of JavaScript, it’s where the magic happens. In essence, a function’s purpose is to allow computers to do what they do best, which is perform repetitive tasks efficiently. We can write a function to perform a loop, count up to 10,000, capitalise names in a list…the options are pretty much endless. A function is why we use computers to perform tasks and not just do them all ourselves. They are basically what computers were designed for.</p>

    <h1>Classes...id<span style="font-size: 80%">s </span> ...who understands em?!</h1>
<h2><em>What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids? </em>
</h2>
<br>
<br>
<h3>What are <em>classes</em> and<em> ids</em> to begin with?</h3>
<div class="class-id">
<p>Classes and IDs are selectors within HTML and CSS which enable the user to choose which sections of code to apply certain rules or styling to. They make it possible to change the colour of text or change how an element is aligned on a page. Classes and IDs serve slightly different purposes which well get into next. </p>

</div>

<br>

<h3>What is a <em>class</em> ?</h3>
<div class="class-id">
<p> A class is essentially a descriptor you can apply to an element to direct that element how to behave. In HTML you can write a class, and then in CSS you can define what that class will do to the element, such as change background colour of text, or create a border for an image. If you like how the class is performing on that element you can apply the same class to other elements on your page. For example, if you would like every second image to have a blue border, you can create a class "blue-border” and apply it to the images in HTML that you want to have the blue border. Then in CSS you can apply the styling to the class “blue-border”. </p>
<p>To observe this syntax, here is an example of the “blue-border” class in HTML, and then in CSS: </p>
<p>HTML:</p>
<img src="Class%20HTML.png" alt="Class syntax in HTML" width="35%">
<p>CSS:</p>
<img src="Class%20CSS.png" alt="Class syntax in CSS" width="35%">
<br>
<p>There is no limit on how many classes can be used in HTML, in this sense they are more flexible, but less powerful than IDs in that IDs have the ability to over-ride a class.</p>
</div >


<br>
<h3>What is an <em>id </em>?</h3>

<div class="class-id">
  <p>IDs are used for a single unique element. There can only be one ID per page of HTML. IDs serve many functions that are similar to classes, with some key differences. The use of an ID in an HTML document is to point to a specific style declaration. </p>
  <p>As we have mentioned, IDs are special and can only be used once per page. Part of their specificity is that they have precedence over classes on the page. If your ID directs an element to do one thing, such as make all text green, and then a class directs to make text red, the text will remain green because the ID takes precedence and is more powerful. </p>
  <p>Depending on how you apply an ID to an element, you can use the ID as a function to jump to a specific section of a page. The ID can act as a pointer to a desired location. For example, I’m sure you’ve encountered a webpage where at the bottom of the page it says “click here to jump to top of page”. You can use an ID to perform this action and ones similar. Here is an example of the syntax: </p> 
  <img src="jumpto.png" alt="ID function" width="35%">
  <p>To use an ID selector in CSS you can specify it by the use of a pound sign (#). An example of the syntax can be seen here:</p>
    <img src="ID%20ex.png" alt="ID example" width="25%">
<br>
  <p>A few rules regarding <em>id </em>s:</p>
    <ul align="left">
  <li>- There can only be one per page of HTML.</li>
  <li>-	IDs are case sensitive.</li>
  <li>-	They must contain a letter and not begin with a number.</li>
  <li>-	They must not contain white space, for multiple words use a hyphen. </li>
  <li>-	Are important when it comes to implementing JavaScript which we’ll cover in future Sprints.</li>
    </ul>
