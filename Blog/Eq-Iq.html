  <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
<div class="class-id">
  <p>Emotional Intelligence is defined as a skill set which encompasses social and emotional literacy, as well as an ability to manage and self-regulate one’s emotions. Emotional intelligence can be learned and developed, it is not something fixed or innate, though some people may find it easier depending on their background or upbringing. Having a ‘high’ EQ may mean you have an easier time navigating social environments, better self-awareness when speaking and listening, and an ability to understand and harness the emotions and emotional state of those around you. Having a good Emotional Intelligence also increases your ability to empathize and relate to those around you.

  <h3>How is it different to Intelligence Quotient?</h3>
<div class="class-id">
<p>IEQ and IQ are quite different. IQ is defined as Intelligence Quotient, and is a set of standardized tests to measure one’s problem solving, analytical skills, logical reasoning, and spatial awareness. The measurements for IQ are contested, but as a concept IQ still holds some weight. IQ tests are often used in education, mental health assessment, in criminal justice, and during hiring processes. </p>
<p>As a whole, the combination of EQ and IQ covers the two aspects of human intelligence. EQ was theorised as a way to grapple and measure intelligence that is not solely “book smarts”. Humans are complex, multifaceted individuals, and the combination of EQ and IQ is an attempt to understand some of these complexities and standardize the measurement of them. </p>

<h3>Why is it important?</h3>
<div class="class-id">
  <p>Understanding EQ and IQ means that we can begin to see how they influence and shape our outlook on the world. EQ can often be neglected, however improving one’s EQ can increase job performance, social satisfaction, and productivity. Our brains are malleable and if we feel that aspects of our EQ are lacking or need development, this is possible through the practise of listening and attention exercises, active self-awareness, and mindfulness. </p>
