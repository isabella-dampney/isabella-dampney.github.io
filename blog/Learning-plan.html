  <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
<div class="class-id">
  <p>I trained and practise as a visual artist, and this is my primary vocation. However, this is a low-paying job that requires a secondary income. After years of working in low-wage jobs to support myself, my long-term goal is to find a job in tech where I can support myself, it has some flexibility about working between the home/office, is ethical as much as possible, and it is engaging. </p>
</div>

<br>
  <h3>What non-technical human skills would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h3>
<div class="class-id">
<p>I would love to develop my collaboration skills. In my art practise I also work collaboratively, but often with the same person. I would love to develop my team work skills to work better in small teams with people whom I might not know very well. In my current line of work this is not something I have been able to build on much since leaving university. </p>
<p>I am also enjoying discovering how I learn when it’s a completely new skill. I would like to understand better my habits and holdbacks when it comes to learning and how I manage my energy. Specifically, I would like to develop better faith in myself when it comes to problem solving, as I struggle with self-doubt a lot</p>
</div>

<br>
<h3>Describe your strengths and limitations.</h3>
<div class="class-id">
  <p>I would say one of my strengths is motivation. I am a very motivated person, and when I would like something to happen I know it takes hard work to get there and I am willing to put in the time. </p>
  <p>Related to this is also one of my limitations. I struggle a lot with focus, which can go in both directions. When I am engaged by a subject I can do it for hours on end and do a deep dive but can often get caught in the weeds and before I realise I am completely off track. The flip side of this, is when there is something I don’t want to do I can be very stubborn and just avoid it for days. </p>
</div>

<br>
<h3>A commitment to how will you manage your workload in this programme. </h3>
<div class="class-id">
  <p>I am comfortable working to tight deadlines. I don’t like leaving things to the last minute and prefer the slow and steady approach. It doesn’t always work out like this though, so I will always try and stay calm and maintain respect for those I am working with and not put my stress onto them. I have some good time-management/stress management strategies, so I will try my best to put them into practise. </p>
</div>

<br>
<h3>How will you manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives? </h3>
<div class="class-id">
  <p>I think always remain as calm as possible. As it is a work environment it is important to remain professional and treat the learning environment as a work place. When I am feeling stressed or overwhelmed I will practise the mindfulness exercises we will learn (or the ones I already have) to remain calm and present. </p>
</div>

<br>
<h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h3>
<div class="class-id">
  <p>It is important not to put your stress onto others, therefore if I am struggling I will endeavour to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>- Not leave work to the last minute so there is time to resolve the situation.  </li>
    <li>- If I have concerns regarding part of the task, I will seek help sooner rather than later. </li>
    <li>- Follow the correct processes for seeking help, try resolve it myself, google it, ask on slack, then ask facilitator.  </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<br>
<h3>Describe what you expect from the facilitation team.</h3>
<div class="class-id">
  <p>During the Sprints an expectation could be our weekly catch up, and aside from that some assistance or support if I am really struggling with something.</p>
</div>

<br>
<h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things?</h3>
<div class="class-id">
  <p>I am working 3 days a week until the end of November when my contract finishes. This is Fri, Sat, and Sun. Aside from this I don’t have any external commitments that are firm.  </p>
