<h2> <em>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make.</em></h2>
<div class="ethical-decision">
  <p> Last year while I was living in Toronto Canada I lived in the downstairs apartment of a house. One day outside with my landlord and roommates, we heard bleating coming from the neighbour’s shed. Our neighbour didn’t drive and lived with his elderly parents. We were all sure we heard the bleating, I was concerned for this potential animal as the shed was very small and only had one small vent. We heard the animal a few more times and also noticed our neighbour spending lots of time in the shed which was uncommon. One night I climbed behind the shed and saw that he had covered the vent with sound proofing insulation.</p>
  <p>I grew more concerned for the welfare of the animal. The ethical dilemma came when I wanted to call the city and ask them to investigate. I was feeling afraid for the conditions of the animal but was also concerned as our neighbour had a history of being unpredictable and my landlord and I both had dogs. As the neighbour was quite retaliatory we were afraid that if we mentioned something to the city and his goat was taken away he would lay poison in our garden. He had threatened us before, and he would come into our garden at night sometimes and damage things.</p>
  <p>In this scenario, I had to weigh up my values of protecting animals, both the neighbour’s, and our own. It was a challenging dilemma as in either situation an animal was potentially in danger. For me it is important to act as ethically as I can and to be loyal to the people I care about. One of the challenges was that I wasn’t certain he would retaliate by hurting our dogs but I didn’t want to run the risk, but I also didn’t know for sure that the goat was safe without fresh air or space to move.</p>
  <p>In the end I decided not to call the city because I felt that the consequences were too great for my landlord. He wasn’t invested in the well being of the goat and at the end of the day the neighbour had the ongoing conflict with him, and not with me as a tenant. Calling the city would have created conflict for others and not for me. It was also not far fetched that something could happen to our dogs so I decided to leave it. I still think about the goat though and wonder if it is ok. </p>

<h2><em>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</em></h2>
<div class="ethical-decision">
<p>As a Pākehā New Zealander my values are strongly influenced by Capitalist values. There is a persistent idea that Pākehā culture is no culture, however this is due to it being the hegemonic culture, and the specificities of Pākehā life are hard to asses from within. Pākehā culture is individualistic and weighed toward valuing hard work and financial achievement as a marker of success. I try hard to push against these feelings and to remember that many people work very hard and aren’t fairly compensated. Needless to say, the idea that hard work and self preservation/reliance on the self is a strong theme in this culture. It has influenced me in terms of how I value myself. However, it’s not something I agree with and as I am an artist I try to retain ties to wider communities, collaboration/broad notions of authorship, and that your value to society does not come from how much money you earn or how much you contribute in tax, but from who you are and how you choose to live. </p>

<h2><em>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</em></h2>
 <div class="ethical-decision">
   <p>I believe my strengths are a strong sense of honesty, commitment to my close friends and family, and compassion towards others. I have a strong sense of intuition which can make me decisive and confident in certain areas. However, this can also lead me to stubbornness, and a desire to know what it is that I am doing and the expense of listening to others. I also believe that I am very honest, and when I work I try to be clear about how I feel and how things are shaping up, I think this can be helpful in terms of moving projects forward. On the flip side, it is possible to be too honest and I worry sometimes that I can be too blunt in meetings. I believe that I have a strong sense of what I want and generally quite a clear vision of the path to achieving the goal. This can be helpful in terms of career development, such as deciding to pursue Dev Academy. A limitation to this I feel is that unless I have a clear path laid out in front of me I tend to get anxious that I am wasting my life or not being productive enough which can be frustrating. </p>

 <h2><em>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</em></h2>
 <div class="ethical-decision">
  <p>One of my strengths is a strong sense of focus and commitment to what I am doing. I struggle quite a lot oscillating between hyper focus and inability to focus. When I am excited or interested in something I can do the same activity for long periods of time without any problem but can end up getting bogged down in the details and struggling to see the whole picture. Alternatively, when I am just getting started on something, or when I encounter a challenge to what I am learning I get very easily distracted and can end up wasting a lot of time. I try my best to remain present, and remind myself of my goals to avoid this happening too much. </p>

<h2><em>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others and strategies used at the time, what would you do differently?</em></h2>
<div class="ethical-decision">
  <p>A little while ago I was a part of a community project to save a library from being disestablished and the collection destroyed. It was a large group of people who were part of the community effort to save the library, however within the group there were different goals and aims, i.e. save the existing library, use resources to build a new library, built an alternative space that’s part community/part library. This fraction caused a lot of tension in terms of how to best reach our goals when there were a few different goals but we were united by the sadness of loosing a space that was important to us. At the time I tried my best to understand the other’s perspective although I didn’t agree with it. I tried to advocate for the resolution I believed in whilst not being stubborn about it, if it transpired that it was 1. Unachievable, or 2. Didn’t have the backing of others. I think the strategies were somewhat effective in terms of reaching a goal that was desirable, however, they left me frustrated and it took a lot of emotional energy going between mediation and advocacy. This time around I would choose a route that was less involved because of the energy toll, and I would instead prefer to take a supporting role to help enable the desired outcome to the group as a whole. </p>
